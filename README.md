# Task3-matching-card-game

This is a matching card game. In the header, there is a "Lives" indicator showing that you have 5 lives (or turns) to find all the matching card pairs.
If you fail to find the correct pairs within 5 lives, the game will restart. The goal is to find two matching cards; if the second card does not match,
both cards will flip back. Finish the game within 5 lives to win! There is also a "Restart" button in the header that you can click to restart the game at any time.
